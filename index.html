                <p>
                    Hi all! I'm Mario. I recently graduated from San Diego State University with a Master's degree in Computer Science, 
                    and I have a deep passion for all types of software development. My academic journey and hands-on projects have 
                    taught me that learning never stops—whether it's mastering a new programming language or exploring cutting-edge 
                    technologies, I believe in the power of continuous improvement. I love tackling challenging problems and turning 
                    innovative ideas into reality.   
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Beyond the world of code, I enjoy maintaining a balanced lifestyle. I’m passionate about working out, 
                    which keeps me energized and focused, and I also love exploring new restaurants—each dining experience 
                    is an adventure that adds flavor to life. Whether it's trying out a new cuisine or catching up with friends 
                    over a meal, I value these moments as essential to both my personal growth and my creative process.  
                </p>

                                        <h3>Inventory Management System: React </h3>
                                        <p>
                                            This Inventory Management System is built with a modern, full‑stack architecture, utilizing React for a dynamic, 
                                            user‑friendly frontend and an Express server for the backend logic, with data stored in a MongoDB database that 
                                            I personally configured and optimized. The system provides robust capabilities for users to view, add, delete, 
                                            and update inventory items. The React interface employs modern state management techniques—leveraging hooks like 
                                            useState and useEffect—to create responsive forms and interactive views. On the server side, 
                                            Express delivers a RESTful API that seamlessly communicates with MongoDB, ensuring that all changes in inventory data 
                                            are processed efficiently. Overall, the application is designed for scalability and maintainability, offering 
                                            a comprehensive solution for managing complex product data in real‑time.

                                        <h3>Red Nose Pirate: C#</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            This was a platformer game developed in a collaborative team environment using Unity and C#. Over a 4–6‑week sprint, 
                                            I worked closely with my peers to design and implement engaging game levels and create enemy behaviors using state machines. 
                                            I was responsible for much of the level design and for programming how enemy characters act and react within the game. 
                                            Additionally, I actively participated in our GitHub version control workflow and conducted thorough code reviews to ensure 
                                            robust code quality. Regular team meetings allowed me to contribute to key game design decisions, ensuring that our collective 
                                            vision translated into an engaging player experience.

                                        <h3>Linux Shell Clone: C</h3>
                                        <p>
                                            Developed a fully functional clone of the Linux shell entirely in C, replicating key command-line functionalities. 
                                            The project supports valid command execution, robust input/output redirection, effective pipeline commands, and the 
                                            ability to run processes in the background. I implemented custom built‑in commands—including directory navigation 
                                            and comprehensive error checking routines—to enhance usability and reliability. 
                                            In addition, I leveraged low‑level system calls to manage process creation, inter‐process communication, 
                                            and resource management, ensuring that the shell functions with proper error handling and efficiency. 
                                            This project not only reinforced my understanding of Unix system internals and C programming but also demonstrated 
                                            the ability to recreate essential operating system features from the ground up.
