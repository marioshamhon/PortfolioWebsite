# Portfolio Website

- **Overview:**
  - This is my personal portfolio website.
  - It was built entirely using HTML and pure CSS.
  - No third-party libraries or frameworks were used—except for one carousel plug-in.

- **Key Features:**

  - **Custom-Built:**  
    The majority of the website was hand-coded from scratch, demonstrating my ability to create a clean, modern, and responsive design with just HTML and CSS.
  - **Carousel Integration:**  
    Although I built almost everything myself, I incorporated a pre-built carousel plug-in. This allowed me to learn how to integrate third-party tools into my project effectively.
  - **Responsive Design:**  
    The design adapts smoothly to different screen sizes, ensuring a great user experience on desktop and mobile devices.
  - **Valuable Learning Experience:**  
    Working with the carousel plug-in improved my understanding of how to combine self-built code with external libraries—an essential skill for modern web development.

- **Technologies Used:**
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
 
- **Future of this Project:**
  - This will be an ongoing project that I will continue to update with new projects.
  - I plan to add backend functionalities in the future.
